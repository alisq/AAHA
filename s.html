<h3>Activist</h3> Right to Remain (Confirmed)
Right to Remain is a research project that examines the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) buildings in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The intensifying pace of SRO conversions from low-income to middle-class housing in the Vancouver Downtown Eastside mirrors previous rounds of creative destruction inflicted on this community through colonialism, racial prejudice, and the withdrawal of care for the mentally ill, veterans, and others who have found refuge here. Together with the activist group SRO Collective, they are organizing tenants to create politics of inhabitation that work against neoliberal forces of dislocation, and pursuing direct action and advocacy for the tenants.
