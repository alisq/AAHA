<h4>Right to Remain</h4>
<p>Right to Remain is a research project that examines the Single Room Occupancy (SRO) buildings in Vancouver’s Downtown Eastside. The intensifying pace of SRO conversions from low-income to middle-class housing in the Vancouver Downtown Eastside mirrors previous rounds of creative destruction inflicted on this community through colonialism, racial prejudice, and the withdrawal of care for the mentally ill, veterans, and others who have found refuge here. Together with the activist group SRO Collective, they are organizing tenants to create politics of inhabitation that work against neoliberal forces of dislocation, and pursuing direct action and advocacy for the tenants.</p>

<h3>Advocate</h3>
<h4>Canadian Cohousing Network</h4>
<p>The Canadian Cohousing Network (CCN) was formed in 1992 in British Columbia, Canada. It is a registered non-profit organization that promotes the creation of cohousing communities as a model for sustainable development by raising public awareness about cohousing and by bringing people together to form communities. The most valuable function of the CCN is making connections with people who are interested in living in a cohousing community. CCN links individuals and cohousing groups together to share resources and make the process of creating a community easier and more economical. The purpose of the CCN is to: promote and facilitate the development of cohousing communities across Canada;  foster public, government, and building professions’ awareness about the nature and benefits of cohousing; provide educational services for creating cohousing communities; enable networking opportunities for those interested in cohousing;  establish standards for cohousing development including accreditation of cohousing professionals; maintain a cohousing resource directory; and provide support services to groups involved in creating cohousing communities. The Society operates without object of gain for its members or directors. Any profits or other accretions will only be used in promoting its objectives. These provisions are unalterable.</p>

Since 1989, we have been designing spaces that reflect the highest ideals and aspirations of our clients, while contributing to the healthy growth and vibrancy of the communities we serve. We aspire to make open architecture—one that can catalyze cultural and economic progress through the creation of inviting public spaces that encourage interaction. Our research-based process involves engaging many perspectives, each enhancing the breadth and quality of our work. We tell the unique story of a place and its people, through the careful shaping of space, and the resourceful detailing of materials. Design is an essential tool for improving people’s lives, and we believe that all architecture should be intrinsically sustainable, beautiful, and built to adapt to the needs of future generations.

                    <p>Gentrification Tax Action (GTA) is a collective of artists and designers formed to campaign for a hypothecated tax that would directly target processes of gentrification in Toronto and help build affordable housing. This tax would be levied as a percentage of the increase in home value, declining from the year of purchase, in order to: 1) disincentivize speculation and the displacement of low income residents, 2) incentivize rental housing, as owners are forced to rent while waiting for the tax to decline, 3) keep the social increment of land profit generated by the community in the neighbourhood, and 4) fund deeply affordable local housing in the form of cooperatives and land trusts. Current members include: artist and documentary filmmaker Sameer Farooq, artist Kika Thorne, artist and urbanist Adrian Blackwell, and landscape architect Jane Mah Hutton.

This includes ESN Parkdale, ESN Trinity Bellwoods, ESN Scadding Court, ESN Moss Park, ESN LNP and ESN Cherry Beach. Outreach volunteers from our network visit encampments daily to deliver basic supplies such as water and tents, ice, sleeping bags, fire safety equipment, and snacks, which the city has consistently refused to provide. We believe all people deserve care, support, and access to water, food, fire safety and sanitation. We advocate for better conditions in encampments, report on city conditions and activity in encampments, and advocate for long term permanent housing for people in their communities of choice. ESN also collects and compiles feedback from residents to support our advocacy efforts and continues to pressure the city to develop real solutions to the housing crisis. The only way to provide effective support and find solutions is by listening to and centring the needs of people experiencing homelessness.</p>

With the municipal emergency shelter system at capacity due to the Coronavirus pandemic, houseless individuals in Toronto began seeking refuge in tents in ravines and public parks. As winter approached, local carpenter Khaleel Sievwright and a team of volunteer builders began raising funds to build temporary insulated structures as warm and safe alternatives to tents for anyone living outdoors. Through a public GoFundMe and in cooperation with community members, Toronto Tiny Shelters delivered over one hundred shelters to houseless individuals in less than four months. </p>

                    <p>Halifax Mutual Aid Society is a group of people who are deeply concerned that the city of Halifax and the province of Nova Scotia choose to ignore houselessness. They stand by while people are left in the cold without access to the most basic shelter. We are tired of these local governments that pretend “the housing crisis” that they created is impossible to solve. We are tired of these local governments who break their own laws and bylaws to allow luxury development that is inaccessible to the average Halifax resident. We are tired of seeing municipal and publicly-owned property being left empty and derelict or sold off to private developers instead of being retrofitted for social housing. In response to the inadequacy, corruption, and incompetence of municipal and provincial officials to solve this crisis, we have chosen to provide some form of shelter to the houseless directly. We will build small, watertight, and insulated shelters for anyone stuck in the cold this winter. We do this because otherwise residents of Halifax will die. </p>

                    <p>The Affordable Housing Association of Nova Scotia (AHANS) has been actively involved in building affordable housing and in upgrading, protecting and better utilizing the province's existing housing stock since the mid-1980’s.

Furthermore, since 2012 AHANS has been the Community Entity for Service Canada’s Reaching Home Homelessness funding program. We aspire to be a non-profit that is resilient, with a housing portfolio that meets the current and changing housing needs. Further, we believe that locally led responses lead to better economic, education and health outcomes. AHANS values respectful, mutually beneficial partnerships with the private sector and non-profit housing providers, and government agencies. We evaluate our activities on our version of the triple bottom line – social, environmental and financial outcomes.</p>
